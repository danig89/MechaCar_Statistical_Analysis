# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze data for AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, and review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. The objectives were to:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
